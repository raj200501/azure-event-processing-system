# Azure-Powered Real-Time Event Processing System

## Overview

This project is a cloud-native, microservices-based real-time event processing system built with Microsoft technologies. It processes and analyzes data streams in real-time, leveraging Azure services like Event Grid, Cosmos DB, and Stream Analytics. Designed for scalability, resilience, and real-time insights, itâ€™s a perfect showcase of cloud-native architecture and advanced event-driven design.

## Features

- Event-Driven Microservices Architecture
- Real-Time Data Processing with Azure Stream Analytics
- Serverless Compute with Azure Functions
- Scalable Deployment with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Machine Learning Integration for Real-Time Predictions
- Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerts

## Technologies Used

- **Microservices:** .NET Core, Docker, Kubernetes (AKS)
- **Event Processing:** Azure Event Grid, Azure Service Bus
- **Data Storage:** Azure Cosmos DB
- **Machine Learning:** Azure Machine Learning, Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Application Insights
- **Security:** Azure Active Directory, Managed Identity
